Finally! I was about to starve. Took you long enough.
About time you made yourself useful. Thanks, I guess.
It's not great, but I'll eat it. Thanks… if that's what you call this.
Wow, you actually did something right for once. Thanks.
Took you long enough to make a simple sandwich. But fine, thanks.
I've had better, but I'll eat it. Don't get too proud of yourself.
Thanks, but next time, try not to mess it up.
I guess this'll do. Thanks… if that's what you were going for.
Took you long enough. Thanks, but don't expect a medal.
Well, it's edible. Thanks… I think.
