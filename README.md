# Secret Sandwich Service

*Birminghack 1.0 (2025) submission*

## Inspiration

Think of it as Papa's Pizzeria x Papers Please...

You're an undercover agent. Running a front for exchanging messages and a base of operations for your team of covert operatives. As a sandwich shop.

Naturally, part of being a good front is to blend in and act like a good, ordinary business, while also facilitating communication between your team. Can you pass notes and keep track of what's going on while delivering excellent customer service?

## Running

Once you have `uv` installed, use `uv run game/` to play the game.
